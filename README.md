## Project Overview
This project is a comprehensive data engineering solution that extracts sales data from a GitHub repository, uploads it to Azure Blob Storage, performs data transformations using Azure Data Factory, and visualizes the results through interactive dashboards in Power BI. The goal is to empower business analysts and decision-makers with actionable insights from the sales data, enabling improved sales strategies, customer targeting, and overall business performance.

## Technologies Used
- **Azure Data Factory**: Used for orchestrating data extraction, transformation, and loading processes.
- **Azure Blob Storage**: Used as the initial data storage solution.
- **Azure Data Factory Studio**: Used for data transformation.
- **Azure SQL Database**: Used to store the cleaned sales data.
- **Azure Data Studio**: Used to verify the success of the ETL process (storing data from Azure Blob Storage to Azure SQL Database).
- **Power BI**: Used for data visualization and dashboard creation.
- **GitHub**: Hosting the raw sales data.

## Dataset Overview
The dataset includes the following columns:

1. **Order ID**: Unique identifier for each order.
2. **Order Date**: Date when the order was placed.
3. **Ship Date**: Date when the order was shipped.
4. **Customer ID**: Unique identifier for each customer.
5. **Ship Mode**: Method of shipping (e.g., Standard Class, Express).
6. **Customer Name**: Name of the customer.
7. **Segment**: Market segment (e.g., Consumer, Corporate).
8. **Country**: Country where the customer is located.
9. **City**: City where the customer is located.
10. **State**: State where the customer is located.
11. **Postal Code**: Postal code of the customerâ€™s address.
12. **Region**: Region within the country (e.g., East, West).
13. **Product ID**: Unique identifier for each product.
14. **Category**: Category of the product (e.g., Furniture, Office Supplies).
15. **Sub-Category**: Sub-category of the product (e.g., Chairs, Binders).
16. **Product Name**: Name of the product.
17. **Sales**: Total sales amount for the order.
18. **Quantity**: Number of units sold.
19. **Discount**: Discount applied to the order.
20. **Profit**: Profit earned from the order.
